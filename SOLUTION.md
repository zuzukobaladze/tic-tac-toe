# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Implementation Details

## Algorithm Overview
This implementation uses the Minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI. The algorithm explores all possible game states to make optimal decisions at each turn.

## Core Functions

### 1. Board State Management
```python
def initial_state():
    # Returns empty 3x3 board
```
- Initializes an empty game board
- Uses `None` to represent empty cells
- Uses "X" and "O" as player markers

### 2. Player Turn Tracking
```python
def player(board):
    # Determines current player
```
- Counts X's and O's on board
- Returns X if counts are equal (X moves first)
- Returns O if X count exceeds O count

### 3. Available Actions
```python
def actions(board):
    # Returns set of possible moves
```
- Returns set of (i,j) tuples
- Represents empty cells where moves can be made
- Scans entire board for empty positions

### 4. Move Results
```python
def result(board, action):
    # Returns resulting board state
```
- Creates deep copy of board
- Validates move legality
- Applies player's move
- Returns new board state

### 5. Winner Detection
```python
def winner(board):
    # Determines if there's a winner
```
- Checks all rows, columns, and diagonals
- Returns X or O if winner found
- Returns None if no winner

### 6. Game State Evaluation
```python
def terminal(board):
    # Checks if game is over
```
- Returns True if:
  - Winner exists
  - Board is full
- Returns False if game can continue

### 7. Utility Calculation
```python
def utility(board):
    # Calculates game outcome value
```
- Returns 1 for X win
- Returns -1 for O win
- Returns 0 for draw

### 8. Minimax Implementation
```python
def minimax(board):
    # Determines optimal move
```
- Recursively evaluates all possible moves
- Maximizes score for X
- Minimizes score for O
- Returns optimal (i,j) move

## Helper Functions

### Max Value Function
```python
def max_value_function(board):
    # Maximizer for X player
```
- Finds maximum utility value
- Used in minimax algorithm
- Recursively evaluates positions

### Min Value Function
```python
def min_value_function(board):
    # Minimizer for O player
```
- Finds minimum utility value
- Used in minimax algorithm
- Recursively evaluates positions

## Algorithm Efficiency
- Uses depth-first search
- Explores complete game tree
- Suitable for 3x3 board size
- Could be optimized with alpha-beta pruning

## Testing
The implementation can be tested using:
```bash
check50 ai50/projects/2024/x/tictactoe
style50 tictactoe.py
```

## Performance Characteristics
- Always makes optimal moves
- Cannot lose when playing perfectly
- Forces draw against optimal opponent
- Can win against suboptimal play

## Future Improvements
1. Add alpha-beta pruning
2. Implement move ordering
3. Add difficulty levels
4. Cache common positions
